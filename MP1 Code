# Here we used the avengers dataset, which is built into RStudio and imported
# from fivethirtyeight to create a simple scatterplot. The scatterplot is 
# split by the numerical variables of year (x) and appearance (y) and is coded
# to show the genders by color for the sake of easier reading. 
# Run ?avengers and View(avengers) in the console for more details.

avengers_recent <- avengers %>%
filter(year >= 1950)

ggplot(data = avengers_recent, mapping = aes(x = year, y = appearances, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Year of Debut", y = "Comic Appearances", title = "SPIDERMAN, YOU OUTLIER (Avengers: Appearances)")
